The combined &quot;srt&quot; matrix is an attribute in the shader program, so it is sent via a vertex buffer object. Note that this method is capable of taking an array of matrices if a count is specified (second parameter), in order to accomodate instanced rendering. If no second parameter is passed, it is assumed that the first parameter only points to a single matrix. Scene::info.vbo" alt="" coords="240,5,405,46"/>
